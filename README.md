# GPT-3 Intent playground demo NodeJS

This is just a late-night experimentation of trying to use GPT-3 to do some intent classification based off of Open AI pet name generator sample. It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/). Follow the instructions below to get set up.

To play with new prompts, it is faster to play with them on the [Open AI playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
